First a Story

One morning I just wanted to play a game. I fired it up.
The first thing I noticed is that there is no sound yet,
even though there should have been some. The dearest ErP
implementations had made it impossible to tell if there
is sound before the speakers get a loud blast, which is
how they get activated. I didn't make much of it. But,
then I also noticed that the volume slider won't affect
my sound card. That was a bit weird, but I just got a
match in the game, and was headed in. Still, no sound
yet? There should have been a loud sound on match start,
why is there no sound coming from the speakers yet?

I didn't have much time to wonder, as the game crashed
right to the desktop. After a few more attempts to rejoin
the match (as there is abandon penalty if I don't), I
started looking at the setup. My sound card setting was
lost, and the OS had selected the mobo sound card instead
the one I was using. Setting that sound card had recover-
ed my ability to play the game too. Apparently, the game
didn't like the integrated sound card for whatever rea-
son.

The Motivation

That had been a lot of stress. And I don't want to repeat
it. Also, other OS tweaks tend to be a tedious chore, e.g.
making sure nothing had re-enabled the task scheduler items
that were manually disabled, or making the registry folders
for each of the app that need their cpu priority level set.

I want that stress and tediousness removed. This app will
help me with it. If it helps you too, go ahead and use it.

There are so many frustrations to take care, and not all of
them pay off time-wise to tackle. But removing the stress
of horrible UX, that is a game changer for me.
